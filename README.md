# BreastCancer_GridSearch
## About DataSet

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous).

This dataset has 569 rows and 32 columns and has following columns 
id

The data has a column named 'daignosis' which says whether the tumor is Malignant (which means cell that spreads uncontrollably and is cancerous) or Benign (which means tumors are not usually problematic).

## About the project :

In this project we use the Kaggle dataset. We load the dataset into a pandas dataframe.

We check if there are any null values.We perform EDA on this dataset.

We encode the categorical data and find the coorelation matrix.

Using the coorelation matrix we find all the columns that are highly correlated to our target column i.e. 'diagnosis', so that we can build our model for these features.

We use three ML models i.e. Random Forest,Decision Tree, Logistic Regression to predict about the dataset

We also use GridSearchCv to tune the hyperparameters of the ML models we are using.

We got random_forest as best model and the accuracy score as 0.952569 and the hyperparameters are {'criterion': 'entropy', 'n_estimators': 20}
